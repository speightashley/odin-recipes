    <h2>Deep fried riceballs with meat and cheese inside</h2>
    <p>
      Arancini is a Sicilian classic that involved deep frying rice balls that
      have cheese and multiple choices of ingredients inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually stuffed with peas, ham, spinach or mushroom, they are the best
      meal in the world!

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Arancini</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        4 ounces whole-milk or part-skim mozzarella, cut into 24 (½-inch) cubes
      </li>
      <li>⅓cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup panko or bread crumbs</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning or dried parsley (optional)</li>
      <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
      <li>1½ quarts canola or vegetable oil</li>
      <li>
        1 cup arrabiata sauce or other tomato sauce (fresh or store-bought),
        warmed
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the risotto: In a medium saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons butter
        over medium. Add onion, garlic and Italian seasoning. Season with salt
        and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5
        minutes. Stir in rice until coated, about 1 minute, then add wine. Cook,
        stirring frequently, until absorbed, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in ½ cup stock. Cook, stirring frequently, until stock is almost
        absorbed, about 4 minutes. Repeat with remaining stock, adding ½ cup at
        a time and stirring until absorbed before adding the next cup, about 15
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once all the stock has been absorbed — the rice should be tender but
        still slightly toothsome and the risotto creamy — stir in the Parmesan,
        the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and parsley. Season to taste with
        salt and pepper. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spread out
        in an even layer and let cool, at least 20 minutes. Cover tightly in
        plastic wrap (or transfer to a lidded container) and refrigerate until
        thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour or up to 2 or 3 days.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the risotto is chilled, slice it into about 24 even portions.
        Working with one at a time, gently roll each into a ball, then press
        between your palms to flatten slightly. Press one cube of mozzarella
        into the center and shape the risotto up and over it, sealing the cheese
        in the center. Roll the ball in your palms until round. Repeat with
        remaining risotto balls. (If you’re not planning to fry them right away,
        arrange them on a small baking sheet in a single layer, cover and
        refrigerate until cooking, up to 2 or 3 days in advance. If the risotto
        mixture isn’t cold, it can fall apart in the hot oil.)
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium. (If you have a candy
        thermometer, now is a good time to use it: Heat the oil to about 350
        degrees.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the breading: Add the flour to a shallow bowl, then add the eggs
        to another shallow bowl and beat the eggs to combine. In a third bowl,
        combine the panko and Italian seasoning, if using, with ½ teaspoon salt
        and ½ teaspoon pepper. Stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working with one arancini, roll it first in the flour, shaking off any
        excess, then in the egg, then in the panko, taking care to coat it on
        all sides with each roll. Transfer to a clean baking sheet. Repeat with
        the remaining arancini.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry the arancini in batches, leaving at least one inch between each
        ball, until golden and crisp on the outside, about 5 minutes. (By the
        time the crust crisps, the cheese filling will melt.) Transfer to a
        paper-towel-lined baking sheet and repeat with remaining arancini. (If
        the crust is cooking to quickly, you can turn off the heat momentarily
        and continue to cook in the oil, which will maintain residual heat. Turn
        the stove back on if needed.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon warmed tomato sauce onto small plates or into bowls and top with
        warm arancini, or set sauce in a bowl for dipping and arrange arancini
        on a serving platter. Sprinkle arancini with finely grated Parmesan and
        more parsley, if desired.
